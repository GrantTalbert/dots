<h1 align=center>Dotfiles</h1>

These are my dotfiles for my university setup. I want to warn everyone that I'm *not a developer*, so a lot of my code is *very bad*. I will also not be writing an install script for my dotfiles, since it will probably break and I don't want to maintain it. I'm posting my dots simply as a reference for anyone who's interested in how I did stuff.

Special thanks go out to the following people:

- **Gilles Castel (RIP)**, for his [blog posts](https://castel.dev/) on LaTeX workflow. Most of the scripts I use for managing LaTeX files are slightly modified versions of his scripts.
- The [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) community, for having a ton of awesome dots to reference. I've looked at too many people's dots to thank them all, but I'll try to mention as many as I can.
    - idk
    - lol
